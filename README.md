# Price Display
Tool to read prices from devices and display it on markets

## Getting Started

First up, visit [RVM install page](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) and follow the instructions to install ruby on your machine. I'd suggest you to install the `2.5.0` ruby version.

Once you have these:

    # Checkout the project
    $ git clone git://github.com/andrerpbts/price_display
    $ cd price_display

    # Install the project dependencies
    $ gem install bundler
    $ bundle install

    # Start the local web server
    $ foreman start -f Procfile
